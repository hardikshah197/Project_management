# Project_management

This is the project management dashboard for any organization.

## Aim of this Project

The aim of this project is to create backend authentication, project, cards management services; along with partial frontend.

## Approach

Created one fodler for backend services with different routes and models.

## Project Guide

### Setup
In order to run the project, you need to run the following commands for dependencies installation for both frontend and backend, then for starting the application. (Node version I have used for development - v14.15.4)
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Point
As discussed before the assignment, partial frontend is also accepted, so I mainly focused at backend side.
